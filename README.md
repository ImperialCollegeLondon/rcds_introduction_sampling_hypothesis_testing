This course provides an introduction to the field of probability and statistical inference.
The topics covered will include basic concepts on probability theory, inference, distributions, and hypothesis testing. 
The aim of the course is to provide strong foundations at the mathematical and theoretical level, while providing practical exercises to work on real data.

The course is organized in three chapters, covering topics listed below. 
All will be followed by a practical session and hands-on coding, both in Python and R. 
No prior experience on statistics or programming is required for the attendance of this course.

## Roadmap of the course

### Chapter 1. Introduction to probability & random events

- Definition of probability and random events.
- Discrete probability; "mass" distributions.
- Continuous probability; "density" distributions.

### Chapter 2. Expected values & parameter estimation

- Mean and variance as expected value.
- Mean and variance as momenta of a distribution.
- The Law of Large Numbers (LLN) and the Central Limit Theorem (CLT).

### Chapter 3. Introduction to hypothesis testing

- Prediction vs inference. Formulating hypothesis.
- General approach. Quantify significance and p-values.
- Compare sample mean to known population mean. One sample t-test.
- Comparing two sample means. Two sample t-test.

### Setup

We will be working with Visual Studio Code / RStudio as main editors. Although recommended, they do not need to be installed in your local computers, since we will use Codespaces provided by Github, which already implement an interface ready to program an execute the code.
Notebook versions are also useful, such as Jupyter notebooks (for the Python version), or Rmd files (for the R version). 
If you want to use notebooks for the practical sessions, we recommend install Anaconda from https://www.anaconda.com in advance of the workshop.

### Getting Started

1. Download this repository to your computer as a ZIP file and unpack it.

2. Open the terminal and navigate to the unpacked directory to work with the .py / .R examples.

3. Open a Codespace where we will be using either Visual Studio Code / RStudio fro the practical sessions.

4. Alternatively, you can run the notebooks online using Binder:
